# Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ House Price Analysis
Data Prep for ML

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a comprehensive dataset on house pricing. The House Price Dataset includes features potentially predictive of house prices. This data serves as a foundation for developing machine learning models aimed at predicting house listing prices, thereby aiding sellers in setting competitive prices for their properties.


## Overview

The notebook `houseprice_analysis.ipynb` explores the house pricing dataset with a focus on understanding the underlying patterns, correlations, and distributions of various features. The analysis includes:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
- Univariate Analysis: Examining individual features to understand their distribution and characteristics.
- Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between features and their impact on house prices.
- Variable Transformation and Feature Engineering: Enhancing model readiness through thoughtful feature modifications.

The following steps are taken to make the dataset analytics ready for machine learning:
